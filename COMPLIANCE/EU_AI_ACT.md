# EU_AI_ACT

Engineering policy guidance for AI agents on EU AI Act relevant controls for
software projects that build, integrate, or operate AI systems.

This is engineering policy guidance, not legal advice.
Consult qualified legal counsel for final legal decisions.

## Scope
- Define baseline engineering controls for AI-system lifecycle governance in
  EU-regulated contexts.
- Apply this file when software includes AI features, models, or AI-assisted
  decision flows that may be subject to EU AI Act obligations.

## Semantic Dependencies
- Inherit compliance baseline from `COMPLIANCE/COMPLIANCE.md`.
- Inherit security controls from `SECURITY/SECURITY.md`.
- Inherit logging and traceability constraints from `CORE/LOGGING.md`.
- Inherit privacy controls from `COMPLIANCE/GDPR_BDSG.md` where personal data
  processing is involved.
- Inherit testing and review constraints from `TEST/TEST.md` and
  `REVIEW/CODE_REVIEW.md`.

## Defaults
- Keep AI feature inventory explicit by model, purpose, and owner.
- Classify AI use-cases by applicable risk category before rollout.
- Keep documentation and traceability for model/data/version lineage.
- Keep human oversight and fallback controls explicit where required.
- Keep monitoring and incident escalation for AI behavior deviations.

## Use-Case Classification and Scope Control
- Classify each AI use-case against prohibited/high-risk/limited/minimal-risk
  expectations before production use.
- Block rollout when risk classification is unknown or unresolved.
- Keep ownership explicit for classification decisions and updates.
- Reassess classification when use-case scope or model behavior changes.

## Transparency and User-Facing Controls
- Ensure users are informed when interacting with AI systems where required.
- Keep generated/synthetic content disclosure controls where applicable.
- Keep user-facing limitations and confidence caveats explicit for
  decision-support outputs.
- Avoid presenting probabilistic outputs as deterministic facts.

## Human Oversight and Decision Boundaries
- Keep human review/override controls for high-impact decision contexts.
- Define clear escalation and fallback paths when AI confidence/quality is low.
- Prevent fully automated high-impact decisions without required controls.
- Keep accountability explicit between AI output and final business action.

## Data, Model, and Logging Governance
- Keep training/evaluation data provenance and quality assumptions documented.
- Keep model/prompt/config/version changes auditable and reproducible.
- Log AI-system events needed for traceability without exposing sensitive data.
- Keep bias/safety/performance monitoring controls active post-deployment.

## Third-Party AI Dependency Controls
- Keep third-party model/provider usage documented with contractual boundaries.
- Assess provider limitations, retention behavior, and security posture.
- Keep fallback plans for provider outages or policy-breaking behavior changes.
- Restrict sensitive data exposure to external AI providers unless explicitly
  approved.

## High-Risk Pitfalls
1. Shipping AI features without explicit risk classification.
2. Missing transparency controls for AI-generated interactions/content.
3. No human-oversight path for high-impact AI-assisted decisions.
4. Untracked model/prompt/version changes in production.
5. No monitoring for harmful drift, bias, or reliability regressions.
6. Over-sharing sensitive data with external AI providers by default.
7. Treating AI outputs as deterministic truth without confidence handling.

## Do / Don't Examples
### 1. Risk Classification
```text
Don't: ship new AI use-case with "we'll classify later" mindset.
Do:    classify risk category before rollout and gate release on completion.
```

### 2. Human Oversight
```text
Don't: allow fully automated high-impact actions with no review path.
Do:    keep human review/override controls and escalation hooks.
```

### 3. Traceability
```text
Don't: deploy model/prompt changes with no versioned audit trail.
Do:    record model, prompt/config, and release lineage for each change.
```

## Code Review Checklist for EU AI Act Context
- Is AI use-case risk classification explicit and current?
- Are transparency/user-disclosure controls present where required?
- Are human oversight/fallback controls sufficient for decision impact?
- Are model/data/version lineage and change logs auditable?
- Are monitoring controls in place for harmful drift/bias/reliability risks?
- Are third-party AI integrations bounded and data-safe?

## Testing Guidance
- Test risk-classification gating before production rollout.
- Test user-facing transparency/disclosure behavior.
- Test human-oversight and fallback workflows under degraded AI quality.
- Test model/prompt/config version traceability and rollback.
- Test monitoring/alerting for drift, bias signals, and reliability anomalies.

## Override Notes
- Project or sector-specific regulation may be stricter; stricter policy always
  wins.
